RNGTools
========

Extra random number generation tools for [Godot
Engine](https://godotengine.org)

Features
--------

-   Shuffle arrays
-   Pick from a set of weighted options easily
-   Random other convenience functions for the lazy
-   All functions have an optional RandomNumberGenerator argument, if
    you want to use your own RNG sequence

### `randi_range(from: int, to: int, rng=null) -> int`

Generates a random integer between `from` (inclusive) and `to`
(exclusive). `from` does not need to be less than `to`. If they are the
same, the number is returned.

``` {.gdscript}
RNGTools.randi_range(-10, 10)
# -3
```

### `pick(array: Array, rng=null) -> Variant`

Picks one element of the array at random, or null if the array is empty.

``` {.gdscript}
RNGTools.pick(["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"])
# "C"
```

### `shuffle(array: Array, rng=null) -> void`

Shuffles an array in-place.

``` {.gdscript}
var array = range(10)
RNGTools.shuffle(array)
# [2, 7, 0, 5, 8, 6, 4, 9, 1, 3]
```

### `pick_weighted(bag: RNGTools.WeightedBag, rng=null) -> Variant`

Picks an item at random from an `RNGTools.WeightedBag`.

``` {.gdscript}
var bag := RNGTools.WeightedBag.new()
bag.weights = {
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 3
}

RNGTools.pick_weighted(bag)
# "B"
```

### `class RNGTools.WeightedBag`

A "bag" of values, each with a weight that determines its rarity.

Higher weights are more common; lower weights are more rare. For
example, an item with weight 2 is picked roughly twice as often as an
item with weight 1.

Use `RNGTools.pick_weighted()` to pick elements from the bag.

### `WeightedBag.weights: Dictionary`

A map of elements to their weights. Weights must be integers.
